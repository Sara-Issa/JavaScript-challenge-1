## Javascript Fundementals Challenge One (Part One)💪🏾

Let's go back to Mohamed and Ali comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations!

> **Remeber:**
> BMI = mass / height ** 2 
> BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

##### Your Task 😃:

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mohamed Ali and Ali Hassan)
2. Create a `calcBMI` method on each object to calculate the BMI. Store the BMI value to property, and aslo return it from a method.
3. Log the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: *"Mohamed's BMI (28.3) is higher than Ali's (23.9)!"*

Good Luck 😀
